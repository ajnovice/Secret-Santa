Secret-Santa
============

Secret Santa Game:
Secret Santa is a secret friend amongst a group of people who will be gifting you for Christmas!

A group of friends elect to be a part of the game Through a random selection each participant is assigned a secret friend
The Secret friend is not himself/herself.

e.g. Four friends Kunal, Vishal, Apoorva, Amrut are the participants of Secret Santa. After the random selection:

Participant      Secret Santa

Kunal             Apoorva

Vishal            Kunal

Apoorva           Amrut

Amrut             Vishal

To work this build a page which accepts the names of people participating in the game. After accepting the selection, the page should display the secret friend of each participant. The secret friend should be a random selection from the given list of players.

Note: Two consecutive runs of the program with same input should not have same results.
